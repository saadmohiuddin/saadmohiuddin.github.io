            <p class="travel-intro">I have been fortunate enough to get to travel a lot at a young age and gained new perspectives and got to experience different cultures, foods and learn about the histories of different places</p>

                    <h3>Hong Kong</h3>
                    <p>The first time I ever went outside of my home country of Pakistan was when I went to College at the University of Hong Kong, one of the best institutes of higher education in Asia. The next 4 years shaped my life as a young adult and is a time I will forever cherish. Hong Kong is an amalgam of the fast paced life of a bustling concrete-jungle surrounded by the the most pristines feats of nature, being surrounded by the ocean and having plenty of green spaces and hiking spots spread throughout the city. Being in Hong Kong island, I was never more than a few miles away from the ocean. Nature might not be the first thing that comes to the mind of people when thinking of Hong Kong, but between running along the Kennedy Town harbour, hiking up the Peak and Dragon's back, and Kayaking in Sai Kung, I fell in love with nature.</p>

                    <h3>Destination 2</h3>
                    <p>As part of the Laidlaw fellowship programme, I got to visit the Philippines for a month in the summer of 2019. In many aspects, Manila reminded me of my homeown of Karachi. The busy streets, street food and colonial architecture were all too familiar. I got to meet wonderful people working on social enterprises and startups achieving great things. I got to work with a Design Thinking Consulting company called On Off Group and learnt a lot from them. I also visited Batangas, the pristine island with beautiful beaches and waterfalls. It was an experience I will always remember</p>
